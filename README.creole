= TreasureMap =

Java library providing simple and standalone use of the JSR-296 ([[https://appframework.dev.java.net/|Swing Application Framework]]) [[https://appframework.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/AppFramework-1.03/org/jdesktop/application/ResourceMap.html|ResourceMap]] implementation.

Requires Java 1.5 or newer.

== Usage ==

Making the resource map:

```java
    package com.foobar;

    import java.util.Locale;

    import com.dteoh.treasuremap.ResourceMaps;
    import org.jdesktop.application.ResourceMap;

    class Foo {
        // Create a ResourceMap for Foo only
        ResourceMap rMap = new ResourceMaps(Foo.class).build();

        // Create a ResourceMap for Bar with Foo's map as the parent
        ResourceMap rMap2 = new ResourceMaps(Bar.class).withParent(rMap).build();

        // Create a ResourceMap for Foo and Bar all in one
        ResourceMap rMapFB = new ResourceMaps(Foo.class).and(Bar.class).build();

        // Create a ResourceMap for RainbowA and RainbowB with a parent map
        ResourceMap rMapWhoa = new ResourceMaps(RainbowA.class).and(RainbowB.class).withParent(rMapFB).build();

        // Create a ResourceMap for the "ABC" Locale
        ResourceMap rMap = new ResourceMaps(Foo.class, new Locale("ABC")).build();
    }
```

For the above example, a properties file named "Foo.properties" should be created in the "com.foobar.resources" package as the properties for the Foo class. For the "ABC" locale, a file named "Foo_ABC.properties" should be created.

By default, the builder will create the resource map using the JVM's default locale.

All ResourceMap use patterns are as laid out by the SAF implementation.

== Key Differences ==

* Extra resource converters: getImage, getDimension
* Explicit locale can be specified
* No need to instantiate the entire application just to load resources. (At the time of writing, BSAF throws a runtime exception if the application is not running. SAF creates a fake application instance.) Not having to instantiate the application allows you to perform unit tests.
